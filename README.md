# odin-recipes
This is my first project using "The Odin Project" program.

In this project, i will put my learned skills to the test using basic HTML knowledge to build a recipe site, where you can browse from different recipes using anchors, and then you will have a list of ingredients and a step by step on how to do every dish.
